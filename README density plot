The exploratory data analysis reveals clear differences between benign and malignant breast tumors based on morphological features. Scatter plots show that malignant tumors tend to have larger size-related measurements such as radius_mean and area_mean, as well as higher texture, compactness, and boundary irregularity compared to benign tumors. The correlation heatmap highlights strong correlations among size-related features, including radius_mean, perimeter_mean, and area_mean, indicating redundancy among these variables. In contrast, texture, smoothness, and compactness provide complementary information related to tumor structure and shape. Finally, the density plot of area_mean demonstrates that malignant tumors are generally larger, with their distribution shifted toward higher values. Overall, these findings suggest that both size-related and shape-related features are important for distinguishing malignant from benign breast tumors.
