This figure visualizes the relationship between mRNA half-life and transcription rate (alpha) using log2-transformed values.

🔹 What the plot shows

X-axis: log2(half_life)

Y-axis: log2(alpha)

Each point represents a gene.

The log2 transformation improves interpretability and allows symmetric visualization around zero.

🧭 Quadrant Classification

Genes are classified into four regulatory regimes based on whether their log2 values are above or below 0:

High half-life / High alpha

High half-life / Low alpha

Low half-life / High alpha

Low half-life / Low alpha

The dashed vertical and horizontal lines at 0 divide the plot into these four quadrants.

This allows quick identification of:

Genes with stable and highly transcribed mRNA

Genes with unstable but highly transcribed mRNA

Genes with low transcription and short half-life

Other regulatory combinations

🧬 Highlighted Genes

Specific genes (e.g., Camp and Ccr2) are labeled directly on the plot to emphasize biologically relevant examples.

🎯 Purpose of the Figure

This visualization helps:

Explore the relationship between RNA stability and transcription

Identify distinct regulatory regimes

Detect genes with extreme kinetic properties

Highlight genes of biological interest
