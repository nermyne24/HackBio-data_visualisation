This figure shows the distribution of new_ratio across different immune cell types using boxplots.

Each boxplot represents:

The median (center line)

The interquartile range (IQR) (box)

The spread of values (whiskers)

Outliers highlighted in red

The x-axis displays the different cell types, and the y-axis shows the corresponding new_ratio values.

This visualization allows quick comparison of variability and median differences between cell populations while clearly identifying extreme values.
