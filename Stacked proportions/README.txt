Biological Interpretation – Dynamic Changes in B and Plasma Cell Proportions (Panel 2f)

This stacked bar plot compares the relative proportions of immune cell subtypes (e.g., B cells and Plasma cells) between two key time points: s00h (baseline) and s72h (late stage).

Each bar represents the total cell population at a given time point, partitioned by cell type.

🧭 Temporal Comparison of Immune Composition

By restricting the analysis to early (s00h) and late (s72h) stages, the figure emphasizes:

Baseline immune composition

Late-stage remodeling of the cellular landscape

Changes in segment height within each stacked bar reflect shifts in proportional representation.

📊 Proportion-Based Interpretation

Because the y-axis represents proportion, this plot highlights relative composition, not absolute cell numbers.

This allows assessment of:

Expansion or contraction of specific cell populations

Shifts in lineage dominance

Redistribution of immune resources over time

For example:

An increase in Plasma cell proportion at s72h may indicate differentiation and activation of the humoral immune response.

A relative decrease in B cell proportion may reflect transition toward antibody-secreting states.

🎯 Biological Significance

This visualization captures immune compartment remodeling over time, illustrating:

Differentiation dynamics (e.g., B → Plasma transition)

Stage-specific functional specialization

Population-level consequences of molecular regulatory programs observed in earlier panels

When interpreted alongside kinetic and pathway analyses, this figure provides a cellular-level readout of the underlying transcriptional and regulatory changes.

🔗 Systems Perspective

Together with gene-level and pathway-level analyses, this plot bridges:

Molecular regulation (half-life, transcription rate)

Functional pathway activation

Cellular population dynamics

It demonstrates how transcriptional and kinetic reprogramming ultimately manifest as measurable changes in immune cell composition.
