X-axis: log2FoldChange

Why we use it:

log2FoldChange tells us how much a gene’s expression changes between conditions.

Positive → upregulated in your experimental condition

Negative → downregulated

Why log2?

Gene expression changes are often very large (10x, 100x)

Log2 scales the data so fold-changes are symmetrical around 0:

+1 → 2× up

−1 → 2× down

Makes the plot easier to interpret visually.

Biological meaning:

Genes far to the left or right have strong expression changes

Genes near 0 → no real change

2️⃣ Y-axis: -log10(PAdj)

Why we use it:

PAdj = adjusted p-value → statistical significance

Small p-values → very significant

Plotting -log10(PAdj) flips it: small p-value → large y-value

Example:

PAdj	-log10(PAdj)


Now “more significant genes” appear higher on the plot.

Biological meaning:

Genes at the top are most reliably differentially expressed

Genes at the bottom → may have large fold change but not statistically reliable

3️⃣ Are these axes “always like this”?

For volcano plots: yes, x = log2FC, y = -log10(PAdj) is standard

Sometimes people tweak the y-axis:

Use -log10(PValue) instead of adjusted p-value

Or change log base for extreme ranges

The concept remains the same: x = magnitude, y = significance
