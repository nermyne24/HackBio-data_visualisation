Biological interpretation of the HBR vs UHR heatmap :

The heatmap highlights distinct gene expression patterns between HBR (Human Brain Reference) and UHR (Universal Human Reference) samples. The selected genes display coherent expression profiles that reflect their tissue specificity, biological function, and the heterogeneous nature of the UHR sample pool. Minor color variations observed among biological replicates are consistent with expected biological and technical variability.
Brain-enriched genes (HBR)
CACNG2 encodes a γ subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels and plays a critical role in synaptic transmission and neuronal signaling. Its elevated expression in HBR samples is consistent with its neuronal specificity, while its reduced expression in UHR reflects the limited contribution of neural tissue in the pooled reference. Slight differences among UHR replicates likely result from variations in tissue composition and technical noise.
CLDN5 is a key component of tight junctions in endothelial cells and is essential for maintaining the blood–brain barrier. Its higher expression in HBR samples aligns with the abundance of specialized vascular structures in brain tissue, whereas its lower expression in UHR indicates the absence of brain-specific endothelial specialization.
SULT4A1 is a sulfotransferase enzyme predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. The heatmap shows strong expression in HBR samples, consistent with its neuronal function, while its near-absence in UHR reflects its minimal expression outside the brain.
MPPED1 is involved in neuronal development and intracellular signaling. Its enrichment in HBR samples suggests a role in neural differentiation or maintenance, whereas its low expression in UHR indicates reduced relevance in non-neuronal tissues.

Genes enriched in UHR (non-brain-specific):

IGLC2 and IGLC3 encode constant regions of immunoglobulin light chains and are typically expressed in immune cells. Their high expression in UHR samples is consistent with the presence of immune tissues in the pooled reference, while their absence in HBR reflects the immune-privileged nature of the brain.
PRAME is associated with cell proliferation and is frequently expressed in non-differentiated or peripheral tissues. Its elevated expression in UHR and lack of expression in HBR suggest activity in tissues characterized by higher cellular turnover, which are absent in mature brain tissue.
PCAT14 is a long non-coding RNA primarily linked to peripheral tissues and proliferative states. Its enrichment in UHR reflects the heterogeneous composition of the pooled reference, while its absence in HBR indicates limited involvement in brain physiology.

Genes related to proliferation and cellular structure :

CDC45 is a key regulator of DNA replication and is typically expressed in dividing cells. Its higher expression in UHR indicates the presence of proliferative tissues in the pooled sample, whereas its low expression in HBR is consistent with the largely post-mitotic nature of neuronal cells.
MYO18B encodes a myosin protein involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell motility. Its increased expression in UHR suggests activity in structural or muscular tissues, which are underrepresented in brain tissue.
Poorly characterized transcripts
RP5-1119A7.17 and RP3-323A16.1 correspond to poorly characterized or non-coding transcripts. Their differential expression between HBR and UHR indicates tissue-specific regulation, although their precise biological roles remain unclear. Nevertheless, their consistent behavior within sample groups supports the robustness of the observed expression patterns.

Overall interpretation :

Overall, the heatmap reveals a clear separation between HBR and UHR samples, reflecting distinct transcriptional profiles. The coherence observed within each group, despite moderate variability among replicates, supports the biological relevance of the results. Importantly, the expression patterns align well with the known functional roles of the genes, highlighting the specialization of brain tissue relative to a heterogeneous tissue reference.
